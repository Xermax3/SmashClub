                    Ultimate, and other competitive games. We regularly host exciting local tournaments on campus. 
                    Our purpose is to create a fun environment where you can openly share your passion 
                    for the series among other students, whether you play casually or competitively.

                            We mainly play Super Smash Bros Melee (on Nintendo GameCube) and 
                            Ultimate (on Nintendo Switch).  But sometimes we also play other games such as 
                            "Mario Kart 8" and "Punch Out!!". We have a total of 1 GameCube (with 4 controllers) 
                            and 3 Switches (with 8 joycons), but feel free to bring your own! 
                            We use computer monitors as screens and usually have about 5. 
                            For big events we also use a projector.

                            Local tournaments take place every week. 
                            We alternate between Super Smash Bros Melee and Super Smash Bros Ultimate. 
                            The winner of the tournament usually earns $50! 
                            If there are enough beginners, a beginner tournament will take place along with 
                            the normal tournament. Feel free to come to spectate too!
                            From time to time, we stream our tournaments and show highlights on our Twitch channel!

                            If you are super good at Smash, you could represent John Abbott College in 
                            Montreal-wide Smash tournaments! In 2018, for instance, our school made it in 
                            the finals of FastFall.  Compete against the best players in the city and make 
                            a name for yourself!  It's a great event if you wish to become a professional 
                            Smash player! You also get to meet awesome people!
